<p align="left">The first day 5th of October 2010 we arrived by Alitalia, which 
stll rather bad to Rome, where we took a room in
<a href="http://cafe.themarker.com/tip/1323237/">Prince of Navona</a>. They have 
two places, we were in the center of the city, Arenula str., 41. 15 min to major 
attractions: 50 s till the nearest kosher restaurant Yotvata, 10 min to Maria 
del Pianta str. of former Ghetto with shops and restaurants. 20 minutes to 
Capitoleum, 10 min to are Sacra, 25 to Forums, 10 to Tiberina and synagogues. 
Only Vatican is more distant.</p>

All the best pictures of living in Rome per se are <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=246079&amp;id=772048189&amp;l=4fce3cd26a">here</a></p>

The next day 6th we had a big trip by foot to all Roman forums and Coliseum. On 
the way we saw Venice square, Marcellus theatre, Octavian portico. All this is a lot! Especially tiresome is Palatin hill, the most impressive is the Titus arch. 
All set of pictures is here:
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=246587&amp;id=772048189&amp;l=009ec75b9e">
Forums, Coliseum, Capitoleum</a>. At the end we also circled Rome by a tourist 
bus. <p>

<p>
The next day we had a planned organized trip to
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=247336&amp;id=772048189&amp;l=e6c3a4653b">
gardens of Vatican</a> (our pictures).&nbsp;
It is unusual and rather spiritual place. 
After that we visited
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=247307&amp;id=772048189&amp;l=1d888034a0">
Vatican museum </a>. There are exciting ancient marbles in the courts of museum, 
but the main impression is Sistine chapel.

At evening we tried to travel 
with two GPS (device and cell phone), but it was a nightmare. The next day I did 
it better, than still better. </a>

<p>
The main rules are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Never ever let it lead you into narrow streets of Rome</li>
	<li>Do not use two of them</li>
	<li>Always see the screen and know which turn to skip. On junctions know 
	where to turn before the junction. On the junction itself sometime the 
	device still does not have enough time to know if you are on junction or 
	turned already or not. So, it sometime gives you the next direction, not the 
	actual.</li>
	<li>Know the general direction, it will recalculate. Sometimes it shows 
	compass also.</li>
	<li>OVI maps in Nokia M86 was a revelation for a movement of foot. Keep it 
	horizontal and will show the map in a comfortable way. Excellent usage is to 
	go out of the car, remember the place in its memory and use for going back</li>
	<li>The same application allows also to seek in categories, like tourist 
	attractions, save them, build a route using saved locations seen on map. In 
	short can be very effective.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Parking</b> in Rome. It is difficult, although there is a big parking with 
payment new Vatican. One must usually seek blue places and pay though automate 
or Tabachi (tabac shop). <b>Good advice:</b> take two places small car, it 
allows parking perpendicular to the pavement in narrow places.</p>
<p>The fourth day, Friday we used for 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Hill">Capitoline hill</a> and its museums as well as to 
buy products and start a trip by boat. Forum may be observed from 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Hill">Capitoline hill</a> 
too, but Titus arch is bit distant. On the municipally of Rome there is a 
picture of&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit">Gilad Shalit</a>. The square has also a a copy of monument for 
Marcus Aurelius, but the original is in the nearby museum. See all this

<p>On Shabbat there were a lot of impressions in the big and small synagogues. 
Acoustics, grandeur and bell canto in the big one, nice crowd in the small one. 
We ate the first time with Israeli pair studying there medicine, in the morning 
near the small synagogue. All people are nice. The payer book and rites are 
rather different from what I am accustomed to. On Shabbat night I made a foot 
trip to arrive to Comedin and a strange pyramid of Gall Cestius.</p>
<p>After Shabbat we succeeded to see several squares: Quirinal, Castor with 
Pollux, Maria Majore, piazza della Reppublica. Difficult, but possible to drive!</p>
<p>We meant to visit Tivoli on Monday, but some of attractions are closed this 
day, so we decided to skip papal blessing on Sunday and go to Tivoli. It also 
was against original plan to go to Naples from Tivoli.

Villa of Hadrian </a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=246123&amp;id=772048189&amp;l=af5abce9a0">
Villa D'Este</a> are very interesting. Hadrian the Emperor build a miracle, 
which is partially preserved, D'Este is of cardinals and full of water and 
fountains. At night we traveled a bit through old Appia road. Later - Trevi and 
Spain square.

<p>7th day, Monday we had a long survey of St. Peter square and the basilica 
(&quot;cathedral&quot;). Opinions were divided, but the pure measurements are impressive. 
And the Pieta by Michelangelo. Later through the day we traveled to hotel in 
Pozzuoli. The trouble was that the hotel in essence not in Pozzuli, but nearby. 
And the Domitian street is about 5 km long and goes through different towns. On 
the way we saw mountains with clouds.</p>
<p>8th day - Herculaneum and Vesuvius, both of great interest:
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=247419&id=772048189&l=513fdf4510">
<b>here</b></a><b><a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=247419&amp;id=772048189&amp;l=513fdf4510">.</a></b>. 
A bit of Naples.</p>
<p>9th day - Capri. They gave us tickets for a circling boat for 13.00. But on 
13:00 he said that not enough people came, so it is set on 13:30. We drank 
coffee in Internet caffe, came 13:15, and the boat left! But then he wistled and 
the boat came back! All the trip was very beautiful except: the Blue Grotto was 
closed due to waves. The heaviest rain started, so we skipped cable car ascent 
into the island and fled. We were very wet and cold, see

<p>The last 10th day we saw different views near Pozzuoli, like lakes and 
temples. The last attraction was very good: Sulfotara volcano, see here:
