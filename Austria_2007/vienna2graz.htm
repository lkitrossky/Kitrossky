<title>On the way from Vienna to Graz</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1 align="center">We went from Vienna to Graz</h1>
<p align="left">The flight was cancelled and the bus was provided instead. 
Flight takes 45 minutes, bus takes two hours. Add also registration and security 
and you arrive to equality. The bus started in the strong rain with dirty 
windows, crossed saddle point and arrived to sunny Graz, still with dirty 
windows though. In the middle of the travel I started to see something strange 
indeed...</p>
