Then Slavs called it Gradez (town, like Hradez Kralove in Czechia), then Germans 
captured it, then Slavs were back. Than Rudolph Founder united German speaking 
people and freed them from Ottokar of Moravia. He started Austria. later 
Hungarians ruled, then Turks devastated the region. Pest etc. Jews were expelled 
in 15th century. In 20th century the synagogue was destroyed again, in 2000 it 
was rebuilt, but is empty.</p>
